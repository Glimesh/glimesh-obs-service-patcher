# Glimesh OBS Service Patcher

This is a simple tool for making sure Glimesh.tv exists in the services list of your favorite OBS distribution. This tool adds Glimesh non-destructively by scanning the existing JSON file for the entry, and if it is not found, appending it to the bottom.

Supports Glimesh FTL & RTMP.
